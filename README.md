# One-Minute Journal

A simple journaling application that allows you to write journal entries limited to 60 seconds. The timer visibly ticks down, and the UI "closes the journal dramatically" after time is up. The note is then saved in a card-like gallery for later viewing. When selecting a note card, it opens in a window to display the full note, along with the date and time of creation and an option to delete the note.

## Features

- **60-second timer**: Write your journal entry within a minute.
- **Automatic save**: The entry is saved automatically when the timer runs out.
- **Card-like gallery**: View all your saved entries in a card-like format.
- **Delete entries**: Option to delete any entry from the gallery.
